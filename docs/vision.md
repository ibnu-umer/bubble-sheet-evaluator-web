**Date:** 20/09/2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
Manual evaluation of OMR sheets is slow, error-prone, and costly.
Most schools and coaching institutes handle 500â€“2000 sheets per exam session, making automation a necessity.

## ðŸ‘¥ Target Users
- Teachers in schools/coaching institutes
- Exam administrators

## âœ… Goals / Success Criteria

### Functional Goals
- Upload 100+ scanned OMR sheets in bulk (PDF/ZIP).
- Detect marked answers with >95% accuracy.
- Export results in Excel/CSV within minutes.
- Provide a clean, simple web interface.

### Non-Functional Goals
- Process 100 sheets in under 5 minutes (performance).
- Results must remain consistent across re-runs (reliability).
- All data stored locally unless explicitly configured (privacy).

### Out of Scope (MVP)
- No mobile phone photo inputs (only scanned A4 PDFs).
- No support for multiple OMR sheet templates.
- No cloud SaaS multi-tenant features.
